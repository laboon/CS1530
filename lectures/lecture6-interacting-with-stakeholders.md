## Interacting with Stakeholders

* What is a stakeholder?
  * Somebody who has a direct interest in the completion or execution of a software project
  * Examples:
    * Developers
    * Managers
    * Customers
    * Users
    * QA
    * Regulatory
  * Note direct: ice cream truck driver may be impacted by tired developers buying more ice cream because they are staying late, but _not_ a stakeholder

* Following is painting with a really broad brush - people are different!

* Customers
  * People who pay for the software
  * Focus: receiving a working system for lowest price

* Users
  * People who use the software
  * Not always the same as customers! e.g. PeopleSoft, GitHub, Facebook...
  * Focus: Usability and meeting their needs / accomplish goals

* Upper Management
  * People who run the business
  * May not know or care about specifics of a product / project
  * Focus: return on investment (ROI) and other financial factors

* Project Managers
  * Manage a specific project (timelines, etc.)
  * Focus: deadlines, meet goals of upper management

* Product Managers
  * "CEO of a product" - determine direction of a product or product line
  * Focus: producing a product which meets the needs of the user

* Quality Assurance
  * People who test software / determine quality of a system
  * Focus: determine quality, release a quality, defect-free product.

* Developers
  * Write code for the product
  * Focus: technical aspects of the project

* Regulatory
  * a/k/a "assessors"
  * Focus: does the product meet the regulatory requirements of its domain

* Note that some different classes of stakeholders have the same (or similar) focus, but go about accomplishing it in different ways
  * e.g. Product manager - user both care about meeting user needs, but how do they do it?

* Reporting and communicating
  * Talk the language of the person to whom you are speaking!
  * What does the class of stakeholder they belong to typically care about?
  * People are individuals - you can make exceptions!
  * Communication != a chance to prove intellect, but to provide/receive information

* Key chasm: technical vs non-technical personnel

* Remember "frame of reference" - varies amongst stakeholders, esp. between technical and non-technical

* Managers are not professors!
  * Professors tend to be more knowledgeable on a topic
    * Will also tend to be very focused and specialized
  * Managers will be less knowledgeable on a topic
    * It is up to individual contributors to have in-depth knowledge

* The Red-Yellow-Green template
  * Subdivide project into subsystems/functionality
  * Give each red green yellow status
    * Red - major problems. Will likely require assistance or will not meet objectives.
    * Yellow - minor problems. May possibly require assistance, or there is a chance that it will not meet objectives.
    * Green - No problems, or very minor ones.  Chances very good that will meet objectives.

* How to communicate? With whom?
  * Will vary by company
  * Chat, email, etc.
  * But if ever in doubt about communicating, probably better to do so
  * Before communicating, ask - does the person need to know this?
  * If so, communicate by speaking in the language of the other stakeholder
  * Communication can be learned!

* Clarification
  * Very important!  English is incredibly ambiguous
    * All natural languages are
  * A conversation is worth a thousand requirements

* Respect
  * Everybody has different skills and deserves to be treated with respect
  * No "you haven't done X?"
  * No "you don't know what a quantum defrobulator does?"
