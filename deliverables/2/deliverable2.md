## CS 1530 - Software Engineering
###Fall Semester 2015

### DUE DATE: 13 OCT 2015

### Deliverable 2

For the second sprint, each group will start implementing user stories on top of the walking skeleton developed for the first sprint. You will also turn in several other reports - see the Format section, below.

Up to half (50%) of the grade _may_ consist of marks from your fellow team members. If you think that people in your group have done basically the same amount and quality of work, you can ignore this, and everybody in the group will get the same grade. If you feel that there has been a major disparity in work output or quality, you may email me (privately and anonymously).

If someone in a group report disparities, I will assume that the git commit history holds the truth and will investigate. At this point, I will grade people separately based on what I see in the git commit history.  For particularly egregious cases, I will discuss with any affected group members individually.  Remember that I will be able to see who committed what to the repository so please commit under your own username! For this reason, you should probably commit the final reports as well (although I will still expect a printed out copy).

### Format

For the first sprint, you will turn in:

A cover page, in the format described below
An approximately one or two page description of what was accomplished this sprint. This can (but is not limited to) cover details such as:
How teams communicated
What disagreements arose
How problems were resolved
Changes in process since first sprint
Interactions with customer
Challenges writing the code or tests
Design patterns or architectural patterns used
Anything else that might be of interest
User stories completed this sprint, and a link to the code on GitHub
Details on why you decided on those user stories
A list of any defects found by testing, and how they were discovered and fixed (or if not fixed, why you decided not to prioritize them). This can include defects found by unit testing or system testing by QA (or other methods, such as issues found by the customer). If no defects were found, then please write a paper on how you have developed a way to develop software without making any mistakes, because I would be happy to read it!
Each of these sections shall be CLEARLY MARKED (i.e. they should each have titles and start on their own page).

#### Format for cover page:

The name of the project
The names of the people in the group, and their git usernames
The date that it is due (13 OCT 2015)
The title "CS 1530 - SPRINT 2 DELIVERABLE"
Grading

Listing of Completed User Stories: 15% of grade
Details of Why Those User Stories Were Chosen: 15% of grade
Description of Sprint: 15% of grade
Listing of Defects: 15% of grade
Code and Tests: 40% of grade

Remember that half of your grade may be dependent on your group contribution!  

Yes, grammar and spelling count. Points will be deducted for more than one grammatical or spelling error per section.

Code should be well-tested; you don't need to do "official" TDD (although I recommend you do so when you can), but there should be good code coverage of common use cases for many, if not most, methods.

Defects should include at least the following information:

Reproduction Steps (or reference unit test that caught failure)
Expected Behavior
Observed Behavior
