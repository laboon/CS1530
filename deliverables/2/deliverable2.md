## CS 1530 - Software Engineering
###Fall Semester 2015

### DUE DATE: 13 OCT 2015

### Deliverable 2

For the second sprint, each group will start implementing user stories on top of the walking skeleton developed for the first sprint. You will also turn in several other reports - see the Format section, below.

Up to half (50%) of the grade _may_ consist of an individual grade. If you think that people in your group have done basically the same amount and quality of work, you can ignore this, and everybody in the group will get the same grade. If you feel that there has been a major disparity in work output or quality, you may email me to let me know (privately and anonymously).

If someone in a group report disparities, I will assume that the git commit history holds the truth and will investigate. At this point, I will grade people separately based on what I see in the git commit history.  For particularly egregious cases, I will discuss with any affected group members individually.  Remember that I will be able to see who committed what to the repository so please commit under your own username! For this reason, you should probably commit the final reports as well (although I will still expect a printed out copy).

If I see nothing from you in the git commit history for a sprint, and you cannot explain and prove it (e.g., you focused on documentation this sprint with the agreement of your teammates, work was done in another branch but couldn't be merged to master, etc.), then you may get a 0 for the entire sprint.

### Format

For the first sprint, you will turn in:

1. A cover page, in the format described below
2. An approximately one or two page description of what was accomplished this sprint. This can (but is not limited to) cover details such as:
  1. How teams communicated
  1. What disagreements arose
  1. How problems were resolved
  1. Changes in process since first sprint
  1. Interactions with customer
  1. Challenges writing the code or tests
  1. Design patterns or architectural patterns used
  1. Anything else that might be of interest
3. User stories completed this sprint, and a *link to the code on GitHub*
4. Details on why you decided on those user stories
5. A list of any defects found by testing, and how they were discovered and fixed (or if not fixed, why you decided not to prioritize them). This can include defects found by unit testing or system testing by QA (or other methods, such as issues found by the customer). If no defects were found, then please write a paper on how you have developed a way to develop software without making any mistakes, because I would be happy to read it!

Each of these sections shall be CLEARLY MARKED (i.e. they should each have titles and start on their own page).

Remember that your main goal is to deliver a working version of the software (i.e., can be compiled and executed on any individual member's computer).  Think about that when planning and prioritizing!  I recommend that you meet today or at the latest, tomorrow, for a sprint planning meeting.  At this point, you can apportion responsibilities, agree on the story ordering, etc.

If I have any questions on the code, I may ask *any* individual member to show me the code running on their computer.  Therefore, if anyone has a problem running the current version of the code, that fact needs to be included as a defect.  Failure to have a working version of the project at end of sprint may mean a drastically lower score for the individual component of the project.

#### Format for cover page:

The cover page should include:

1. The name of the project
1. The names of the people in the group, and their git usernames
1. The date that it is due (13 OCT 2015)
1. The title "CS 1530 - SPRINT 2 DELIVERABLE"

### Grading

Group Grading:

1. Listing of Completed User Stories: 15% of grade
1. Details of Why Those User Stories Were Chosen: 15% of grade
1. Description of Sprint: 15% of grade
1. Listing of Defects: 15% of grade
1. Code and Tests: 40% of grade

Remember that half of your grade may be an individual grade!  

Yes, grammar and spelling count. Points will be deducted for more than one grammatical or spelling error per section.

Code should be well-tested; you don't need to do "official" TDD (although I recommend you do so when you can), but there should be good code coverage of common use cases for many, if not most, methods.

Defects should include at least the following information:

1. Reproduction Steps (or reference unit test that caught failure)
1. Expected Behavior
1. Observed Behavior
