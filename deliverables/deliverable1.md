# CS 1530 - Software Engineering
Summer Semester 2015

## DUE DATE: 10 JUNE 2015

## Deliverable 1

For the first sprint, each group will need to determine initial user stories for the project, write a walking skeleton of the application, and determine a test plan and prioritization of user stories.  Additionally, you will turn in a Deliverable with all of this information and how you decided upon the prioritization, test plan, user stories, etc.

Teams should contain at least one person (multiple people can have the same role)  for each of the following roles:
1. Project Owner / Scrum Master - Focuses on deadlines, prioritization, and ensuring the software meets the needs of the customer.  Often the "point person" between the customer and the rest of the group.
2. Software Developer - Focuses on developing the software.
3. Quality Assurance Manager - Focuses on assuring the quality of the software, mainly through tests.

This does not mean these are the only possible roles (for example, your group may decide that you need someone specifically to work on documentation), or an ironclad guarantee that you will only do that role.  For example, QA managers will certainly write code, at least for tests; project managers may write code and help decide what to test; and developers will have to write tests as part of the code when programming using TDD.

## Format

For the first sprint, you will turn in:

1. A cover page, in the format described below
1. A backlog of user stories, ranked
2. A "walking skeleton" application available on GitHub
3. A description of what you plan to test, what tools you think you will need, and why
4. A description of how you determined the user stories, and how you prioritized them

Each of these sections shall be CLEARLY MARKED (i.e. they should each have titles and start on their own page).

Format for cover page:
* The name of the project
* The names of the people in the group, and their roles
* The date that it is due (10 JUNE 2015)
* The title "CS 1530 - SPRINT 1 DELIVERABLE"

## Grading
* User Stories and Ranking: 40% of grade
* Walking Skeleton: 15% of grade
* Test Outline: 10% of grade
* Decision Descriptions: 35% of grade

User stories shall be in the Connextra template and provide good, user-level descriptions of user needs and wants.  User stories should be printed in order of priority.  It is NOT expected that you will complete every single user story, or even that these are the final versions of the user story; they may change and be prioritized differently as the sprints go on.

User stories should flow from the needs of the customer.  Your discussions with the customer should guide the user stories themselves as well as their prioritization.

The number of user stories will vary based on the project, but it should be at least eight at the VERY minimum.  If there are fewer than eight stories, the project may be too small or your user stories too big.

The walking skeleton __must__ compile and show some minimal output (this can be as simple as a debug statement, "Hello, World!" on the console, etc.)  It should follow the general outline of a walking skeleton as discussed in GOOSGBT.  You can have more, but it is essential that your program compiles and runs without error!

The test outline should be at least several paragraphs explaining what sorts of things you think will need to be tested, and why.  Remember to include functional and non-functional aspects (reliability, scalability, performance, etc)!

The description of decisions should be, at an absolute minimum, one page of text.  It should include any background research you did on the domain, your interactions with the customer, and your team's opinions on prioritization.  Be sure to include any __disagreement__ your team had internally!  Software engineering is rarely without some sort of disagreement about the direction of the software. 

The description of decisions should also indicate what you think is effective and ineffective during this sprint, and what you plan to do about these going forward.  For example, stand-ups took up too much time so we're shortening them, people were stepping over each other's code so the team is going to use a different branching model, etc.  This concept of continuous improvement is important to the Scrum methodology.

Yes, grammar and spelling count.  Points will be deducted for more than one grammatical or spelling error per section.
