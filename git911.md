Please fork BadRepo[1-4] repositories under GitHub username laboon.

BadRepo1 - Somebody accidentally sent a commit which deleted all of the codes.  How can you fix this?

BadRepo2 - Somebody merged a branch, but was in a real hurry and didn't check if it compiled.  Can you recover while still ensuring that their changes get merged in (that is, you don't just revert to the previous version)?	

BadRepo3 - Somebody created a branch with oh-so-many commits.  Can you compress them all down into one commit?

BadRepo4 - Merge the wjl_derp branch into master. Deal with the merge conflicts as best you can.

If you finish these, can _you_ make a messed-up git repository?  Messed up in a different way, that is?  If so, and I decide to use it for my next "Git 911", it can mean bonus points for you!
