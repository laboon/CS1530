Please fork all BadRepo repositories under GitHub username laboon.

BadRepo0 - 

BadRepo1 - Somebody accidentally sent a commit which deleted all of the codes.  How can you fix this?

BadRepo2 - Somebody merged a branch, but was in a real hurry and didn't check if it compiled.  Can you recover while still ensuring that their changes get merged in (that is, you don't just revert to the previous version).

BadRepo3 - Somebody created a branch with oh-so-many commits.  Can you compress them all down into one commit?

BadRepo4 - Simply merge the wjl_derp branch into master.
